# C-GRAPHICS
`C-GRAPHICS` floppy disk distributed by Kern Publishing.

This came from an unknown floppy disk I acquired from a lot of 5.25" floppies purchased on eBay. I know nothing further about this disk or it's contents. I do not know if the object code files are compiled from the C or the BASIC versions of the routines. I also haven't read the source code and don't know if the BASIC code is a reimplementation of the C code, or simply an example program that uses the C functions in the same named library. 

This is being uploaded for preservation and posterity. The CGRAPHIC.IMA disk image contains a FAT filesystem that MS-DOS 6.x can read, but modern Windows, Linux, and the FAT support of 7-zip can't read. It's from a very early version of IBM PC-DOS, as noted by the included COMMAND.COM. The disk isn't bootable, however - it's lacking `IBMBIO.SYS` and `IBMDOS.SYS`.
